# M00 "Introduction to Python with Google Colab"

Learn [Python][1] programming language using Google [Colab][2]. Whether you have never programmed before, already know basic syntax, or want to learn about the advanced features of Python, this course is for you. Our goal is to bring you up to speed with Python as quickly as possible so you can build programmes that work – basic functions, file handling, and data exploration – while developing a foundation in programming that will serve you well in your workplace.

> ***What is Colaboratory?***
> 
> *« Colaboratory, or “Colab” for short, is a product from Google Research. Colab allows anybody to write and execute arbitrary python code through the browser, and is especially well suited to machine learning, data analysis and education. More technically, Colab is a hosted Jupyter notebook service that requires no setup to use, while providing access free of charge to computing resources including GPUs. »*
